# Dagins

## A command line utility to keep you accountable about your daily habits cultivation

It helps to keep you 100 with yourself.

### Usage

Set _habit creation_ goal:

    $ dagins goal create "learn go" --daily
    # --daily is the default flag

Then check if you paid your bills are paid:

    $ dagins goal status "learn go"
    ➜ Do it!

Go do your thing and let `dagins` know that you were a trooper about it:

    $ dagins goal done "learn go"
    ➜ Way to go. I will be here for you tomorrow.


## Should I use it?
